#python program to check if a number is odd or even
#A number is even if division by 2 gives a remainder of 0.
#If the remainder is 1,it is an odd number.

#Even odd program using Modulus operator
num = int(input("Enter a Number: "))
if (num % 2) == 0:
   print(num,"is even")
else:
   print(num,"is odd")


#Even odd program using Bitwise operator
num = int(input("Enter a Number: "))
if(num&1)==0:
   print(num,"is even")
else:
   print(num,"is odd")
